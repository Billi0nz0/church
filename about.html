            <h1> Our History </h1>
            <p>
                Global Champions Ministries was founded in May 2015 by Apostle Ifeanyi Ugochi with a divine mandate to raise champions for 
                Christ and impact lives through the power of the gospel. Since its inception, the ministry has been committed to spreading 
                the message of faith, hope, and transformation across communities. What began as a vision has grown into a vibrant fellowship 
                where believers are equipped, empowered, and inspired to fulfill their God-given destinies.
